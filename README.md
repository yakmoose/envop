# Envop
Envop is a simple cli tool for storing .env files in 1Password. It reads files in a similar order to the symfony/dotenv package, 
but does not mess around with picking up an environment from an `.env.local` file. 

It requires a 1Password connect instance to be running in order to do interact with secrets in 1Password.
